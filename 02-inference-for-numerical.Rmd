# Inference for Numerical Data {-}

```{r graphic4, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/meet_data.jpg")
```

Using the data from the yrbss survey, we will now analyze the weight of the students in kilograms, stored in the `weight` variable in the `yrbss` data frame.

We can obtain the summary statistics of the variable by running the following code:

```{r summary, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
summary(yrbss$weight)
```

To visualise the distribution of the weights, you may want to produce a box-plot for the `weight` variable by running the following code:

```{r boxplot, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yrbss, mapping = aes(y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Exercise 1 {-}

Another way of visualising the distribution of a variable is to look at the histogram of the data. Write code to produce a histogram for the `weight` variable.

`r hide("Hint")`
We want to use the function `ggplot()`, specifying the data argument and the variable to go along the $x$-axis. Use `geom_histogram()` to produce a histogram.
`r unhide()`

```{r ex1_solution, webex.hide="Solution", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yrbss, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r MCQ1}
opts_Q1 <- sample(c("The weights of the students appear fairly normally distributed, but are a little left skewed i.e. have a long tail on the left of the histogram.",
                    "The weights do not actually appear very normally distributed, and probably follow some other distribution.",
                    answer = "The weights of the students appear fairly normally distributed, but are a little right-skewed i.e. have a reasonably long tail on the right of the histogram.",
                    "The weights are perfectly normally distributed."))
```

<br>

**How would you describe the distribution of the weights of the students?**
`r longmcq(opts_Q1)`

`r hide("Hint")`
Look carefully at the shape of the graph, particularly towards the right.
`r unhide()`

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler's weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualise trends, identify strong associations and develop research questions.

First, we will create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be coded as either "yes" if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and "no" if not, using the `mutate()` function.

```{r create_newvar, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
yrbss <- yrbss %>%
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(yrbss$physically_active_7d > 2, "yes", "no"))
```

Look at the code below that creates a boxplot. If you wanted to add another dimension to the boxplot, say, splitting it by some other variable, you would want to add an `x =` argument inside the `aes` bracket, making sure there's a comma between it and the `y = weight` part. Some variable name would follow the `x =`.

```{r boxeg, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = yrbss, mapping = aes(y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

<br>

### Exercise 2 {-}

Make a side-by-side boxplot of `physical_3plus` and `weight` i.e. a boxplot with the `physical_3plus` variable on the x axis and the `weight` variable on the y axis. This will show side by side the boxplots of weights, comparing between the yes and no for `physical_3plus`.

`r hide("Hint")`
With the `aes()` argument you want to specify that `x = physical_3plus`.
`r unhide()`

```{r ex2_solution, webex.hide="Solution", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = yrbss, aes(x = physical_3plus, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r MCQ2}
opts_Q2 <- sample(c("The median weight appears to be higher for those that are not physically active 3+ days a week.",
                    "The mean weight appears to be higher for those that are physically active 3+ days a week.",
                    answer = "The median weight appears to be higher for those that are physically active 3+ days a week.",
                    "Those that are physically active 3+ days a week on average weigh more."))
```

<br>

**What could you interpret from this graph?**
`r longmcq(opts_Q2)`

`r hide("Hint")`
This is just an initial impression, so we don't decide anything for certain yet until we've done some analysis.
`r unhide()`

<br>

The box plots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using the same procedure that we used back in Exercise 1, except our summary this time is a mean rather than a count. Run the code below to see the mean weights of the students, separated by "yes" they are physically active 3+ days a week or "no" they aren't.

```{r summ_by_phys3, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

There is an observed difference, but is this difference statistically significant? In order to answer this question we will conduct a **hypothesis test**.
